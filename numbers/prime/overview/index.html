<h1>Prime Numbers</h1>

<p>
A <strong>prime number</strong> is a natural number greater than 1 that has
<strong>no positive divisors other than 1 and itself</strong>.
</p>

<p>
In other words, a prime number cannot be built by multiplying two smaller
natural numbers. It stands on its own.
</p>

<h2>Simple Examples</h2>

<p>Some prime numbers are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17</li>
</ul>

<p>Some numbers that are <strong>not</strong> prime:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 (special case)</li>
  <li>4 = 2 × 2</li>
  <li>6 = 2 × 3</li>
  <li>9 = 3 × 3</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every non-prime number greater than 1 can be written as a product of
smaller numbers.
</p>

<h2>Why 1 Is Not Prime</h2>

<p>
At first glance, 1 may seem like it should be prime — after all, it has
only one divisor.
</p>

<p>
However, primes are meant to be the <strong>building blocks of natural
numbers</strong>. If 1 were considered prime, factorisations would no longer
be unique.
</p>

<p>
To preserve a clean and consistent structure of arithmetic,
<strong>1 is excluded</strong>, and primes are defined to start from 2.
</p>

<h2>The Role of Prime Numbers</h2>

<p>
Prime numbers act like the <strong>atomic elements of arithmetic</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Every natural number greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes,
and this expression is unique (up to order).
