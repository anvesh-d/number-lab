<p>
A <strong>prime number</strong> is a natural number greater than 1 that has
<strong>no positive divisors other than 1 and itself</strong>.
</p>

<p>
In other words, a prime number cannot be built by multiplying two smaller
natural numbers. It stands on its own.

  <h2>Simple Examples</h2>

  <p>Some prime numbers are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some numbers that are <strong>not</strong> prime:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (special case)</li>
    <li>4 = 2 × 2</li>
    <li>6 = 2 × 3</li>
    <li>9 = 3 × 3</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    Every non-prime number greater than 1 can be written as a product of
    smaller numbers.

  <h2>Why 1 Is Not Prime</h2>

  <p>
    Prime numbers are meant to be the building blocks of arithmetic.
    To preserve unique factorisation, 1 is excluded.

  <h2>The Role of Prime Numbers</h2>

  <p>
    Prime numbers act like the atomic elements of arithmetic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every natural number greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of
    primes, and this expression is unique (up to order).
